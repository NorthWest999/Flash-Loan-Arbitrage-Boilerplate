# Flash-Loan-Arbitrage-Boilerplate
A comprehensive flash loan arbitrage platform leveraging Aave V3, Uniswap v3, and Sushiswap – featuring Foundry-based smart contracts, Node.js arbitrage bots, and an Express.js monitoring dashboard for 24/7 operation.
This repository provides a full-stack solution to detect arbitrage opportunities and execute flash loan transactions atomically.

Features
Smart Contracts:
A Foundry-based Solidity contract (FlashLoanArbitrage.sol) that requests flash loans from Aave V3, executes arbitrage logic (to be extended with actual DEX interactions), and ensures that the loan plus fees are repaid within the same transaction.

Arbitrage Bots:
Two Node.js bots (for ETH-DAI and ETH-USDC) that continuously monitor price differences between decentralized exchanges and trigger the flash loan smart contract when profitable conditions are met.

Monitoring Dashboard:
A simple Express.js server that serves a web dashboard showing real-time status, the last executed transaction hash, and cumulative profit for each bot.

Process Management with PM2:
A PM2 ecosystem configuration to manage all Node.js processes (bots and dashboard) for continuous 24/7 operation.

Automation Scripts:
Scripts for deploying the smart contract and for starting/stopping the bots and dashboard.

Scalable Architecture:
Designed to easily add additional arbitrage strategies (e.g., new token pairs) by replicating the bot folder structure.

Prerequisites
Node.js (v18.x LTS or later)

NPM (or Yarn) for managing Node.js dependencies

Foundry for developing, testing, and deploying Solidity contracts

PM2 (install globally via npm install -g pm2) for process management

Git for version control

An Ethereum RPC Endpoint (e.g., Infura or Alchemy)

An Ethereum account with sufficient ETH (for gas fees) to deploy and execute flash loan transactions

Installation
1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine or server:

bash
Kopieren
git clone git@github.com:your-username/flash-loan-arbitrage-boilerplate.git
cd flash-loan-arbitrage-boilerplate
2. Install Smart Contract Dependencies
Foundry will resolve Solidity dependencies automatically. To compile the smart contracts, run:

bash
Kopieren
forge build
3. Install Node.js Dependencies
For each arbitrage bot, install the Node.js dependencies:

bash
Kopieren
cd bots/eth-dai
npm install

cd ../eth-usdc
npm install
For the dashboard, do the following:

bash
Kopieren
cd ../../dashboard
npm install
Configuration
Each component uses environment variables for configuration. Example .env files are provided (do not commit your real keys).

For Bots
Copy the example .env files in each bot directory and update with your values.

Example for bots/eth-dai/.env:

bash
Kopieren
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
FLASHLOAN_CONTRACT=0xYourDeployedContractAddress
ASSET_BORROW=0xC02aaa39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27ead9083C756Cc2   # WETH address on Mainnet
STABLE_ASSET=0x6B175474E89094C44Da98b954EedeAC495271d0F   # DAI address on Mainnet
BORROW_AMOUNT_ETH=1
PRICE_DIFF_THRESHOLD=5
Similarly, update bots/eth-usdc/.env.example for the USDC bot.

For Deployment (Optional Root .env)
You may create a .env file in the project root for deployment variables used by the deploy script:

bash
Kopieren
RPC_URL=https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID
DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY
POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER=0xYourAavePoolAddressesProvider
Deployment
Smart Contract Deployment
Make sure Foundry is installed and the environment variables (RPC_URL, DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY, POOL_ADDRESSES_PROVIDER) are set.

Run the deploy script from the project root:

bash
Kopieren
chmod +x scripts/deploy.sh
./scripts/deploy.sh
The script compiles and deploys the FlashLoanArbitrage.sol contract. It will output the deployed contract address, which you should then update in the FLASHLOAN_CONTRACT variables in the bot .env files.

Starting All Services with PM2
Install PM2 globally if not already installed:

bash
Kopieren
npm install -g pm2
From the project root, start all processes:

bash
Kopieren
chmod +x scripts/start_all.sh
./scripts/start_all.sh
Check the running services:

bash
Kopieren
pm2 status
To view the logs of all services:

bash
Kopieren
chmod +x scripts/logs.sh
./scripts/logs.sh
Usage
Arbitrage Bots:
The bots continuously check for arbitrage opportunities every 30 seconds. When a profitable opportunity is detected (based on the configured threshold), they trigger the flash loan request by calling the deployed smart contract. Logs are output to the console (and managed by PM2).

Dashboard:
Access the monitoring dashboard at http://localhost:3000 (or the port defined in your .env for the dashboard). It displays the current status of each bot, the last transaction hash, and the cumulative profit.

Monitoring & Process Management:
Use PM2 commands (e.g., pm2 restart <name>, pm2 stop <name>) to manage your bots and dashboard. PM2 will also ensure that the processes restart automatically if they crash.

git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
Workflow for Future Development
